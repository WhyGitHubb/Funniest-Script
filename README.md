If you want your own custom image you can use this python code utilizing the image library!

```
  import Image
  im = Image.open('your image.png') 
  pixels = list(im.getdata())
```
this will return every single rgb value in the img into a table/array!
now just save it into text then replace all the instances of normal brackets to curly brackets in notepad! 
then put it all inside the Values table in funny.lua and execute!
